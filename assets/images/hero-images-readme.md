## Notes:
- All images are created as SVG files for scalability and performance
- Images use the theme's color scheme (#3b82f6 blue gradient)
- Text labels match the content they represent
- Professional styling with subtle decorative elements

## To Replace with Real Images:
Simply replace any of these SVG files with actual photographs or graphics while maintaining the same filenames and approximate dimensions.
- Maintain consistent color scheme with the theme (blues/whites work well)
- Optimize images for web (compressed but still high quality)
- Consider using WebP format for better performance

## Alternative Sources:

- Use stock photos from Unsplash, Pexels, or Shutterstock
- Create custom illustrations
- Use actual photos of your team and workspace
- Hire a photographer for professional business photos

Replace these placeholder files before launching your website.
