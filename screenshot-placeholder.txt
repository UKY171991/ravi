# Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the theme screenshot. 

To complete the theme setup:

1. Create a screenshot.png file (1200x900 pixels recommended)
2. Place it in the root theme directory
3. The screenshot should show the theme's homepage design

The screenshot will be displayed in the WordPress admin under Appearance > Themes.

For best results, the screenshot should:
- Be exactly 1200x900 pixels
- Show the homepage hero section
- Include navigation and key design elements
- Be saved as a PNG file
- Be named exactly "screenshot.png"
